# Outsourcing_Impact_Dashboard
A dashboard to present the levels and impacts of privatisation in England's social care sectors

Welcome to the repository for our outsourcing impacts tracker. Ignore most of the files - this repo needs cleaning up.

The dashboard is built with python's Dash module and deployed via [Render](https://render.com/). The 'dashboard_app' file is the final file which is used to deploy the app. the 'dashboard_code' file is what I use to run the dashboard on my local machine.

The data is taken directly from another repository - you can see that in the code - it comes from [here](https://github.com/BenGoodair/childrens_social_care_data/tree/main/Final_Data/outputs)

That data is built, using a reproducible pipeline of R code from this repo [here](https://github.com/BenGoodair/childrens_social_care_data/tree/main). 

The website is under development and not for sharing widely yet - but a test link is available upon request. HMU at benjamin.goodair@spi.ox.ac.uk
